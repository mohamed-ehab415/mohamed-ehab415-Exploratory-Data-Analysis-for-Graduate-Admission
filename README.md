# Admission Prediction Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset to predict the probability of admission into a graduate program. The dataset includes features like GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, statement of purpose (SOP) strength, letter of recommendation (LOR) strength, CGPA, and whether the applicant has research experience. 

## Key Features of the Dataset
- **GRE Score**: Graduate Record Exam score (integer).
- **TOEFL Score**: Test of English as a Foreign Language score (integer).
- **University Rating**: Rating of the university (categorical, converted to object).
- **SOP**: Strength of the statement of purpose (continuous float).
- **LOR**: Strength of letters of recommendation (continuous float).
- **CGPA**: Undergraduate GPA (continuous float).
- **Research**: Indicates whether the applicant has research experience (binary, converted to object).
- **Chance of Admit**: Target variable (float).

## Objectives
1. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Understand the correlation between features and the target variable.
4. Provide visual insights into the data.

## Workflow
### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed the `Serial No.` column as it is irrelevant.
- Renamed columns for consistency (e.g., `'Chance of Admit '` to `'Chance of Admit'`).
- Checked for missing values and found none.
- Ensured appropriate data types for numerical and categorical features.

### 2. Data Distribution Analysis
- Used histograms and KDE plots to analyze feature distributions.
- Identified slight skewness in some features but found no extreme values.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### Univariate Analysis
- **Numerical Features**:
  - Visualized the distributions of GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, SOP, and LOR.
  - Added key statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) to the plots.
- **Categorical Features**:
  - Analyzed the `Research` and `University Rating` variables.
  - Converted them to categorical (object) for better analysis.

#### Correlation Analysis
- Created a correlation heatmap to identify relationships between features and the target variable.
- Observed:
  - CGPA had the highest correlation (0.87) with `Chance of Admit`.
  - GRE, TOEFL, LOR, and SOP also showed significant positive correlations (~0.67).

#### Scatterplots
- Explored linear relationships between numerical features and `Chance of Admit`.
- Found clear trends for GRE, TOEFL, and CGPA with the target variable.

#### Boxplots
- Investigated categorical features (`Research` and `University Rating`) against `Chance of Admit`.
- Found:
  - Applicants with research experience have higher chances of admission.
  - Higher university ratings are associated with better chances.

### 4. Insights
- Strong academic performance (CGPA, GRE, TOEFL) is crucial for admission chances.
- Research experience significantly boosts the likelihood of acceptance.
- University rating is another key factor influencing admission probability.

### 5. Recommendations
- Highlight the importance of CGPA and research experience for prospective applicants.
- Develop models for predicting `Chance of Admit` using the cleaned data.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `plotly`

## Running the Analysis
1. Load the dataset using the provided file path.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
3. Execute the script to reproduce data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis.

## Future Work
- Train machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, random forest) to predict `Chance of Admit`.
- Optimize feature engineering and evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE and R².
